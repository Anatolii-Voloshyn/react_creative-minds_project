This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

In this project, I created a full-stack React application using Firebase. In this messaging board, you can leave your thoughts and it's public to everyone. It's an off-system with a dashboard where you can go in with a Google account and create a new post, edit your post, and delete it. On the post, people can leave comments.

1. Use the "Join In" button and Log in with your Google account.
2. Go to the "Post" button and create a new post (max length = 300 symbols).
3. Comment on your post or the post of other people.
4. Go to your page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner and edit or delete your post.
5. Click on "Creative Minds" and go to the main page.
